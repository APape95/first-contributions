name: Amy Pape :  Would it be benifical to have a list of project ideas for new starters included?
about: We could create a working list of project ideas and skills that would be showcased by doing each project.  

New programmers as well as experienced could keep their porfolios up to date showcasing skills they have. We could look to have key skills with several project ideas, essentially we'd build a working list of projects we could complete to showcase a skill we need to show. 

For example, you're really instrested in a role but the job description is looking for a skill you have but don't have much evidence of in your portfolio, come to our list see which project would be best to complete and then you're going to have a much higher chance of the role.
